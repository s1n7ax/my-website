## Deployment

Deployment is done using docker images.

Github workflow in this project, builds a new image and push it to docker hub.
For the deployment, SSH should be configured in the server.

Following secrets should be registered in the Github Actions

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - Name of the docker hub user
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` - Access token
- `DO_IP` - IP of the server
- `DO_USERNAME` - Name of the user in the server
- `DO_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - SSH Private key

## SSL & TSL update

Using the `certbot` client, we can request a new certificate.

```shell
docker compose up certbot
```

Let's encrypt certificate will be outdated in 90 days. So another request has
to be made to update. This can be automated using a cron job
